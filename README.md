# About Infect3d
Previously a Test & Measurement Support Engineer in telecommunications.
I gently switched to web3 security through audit contest platforms such as [Code4rena](https://code4rena.com/), [Sherlock](https://www.sherlock.xyz/) or [CodeHawks](https://www.codehawks.com/)
Moved full-time web3 in October-2023
You'll find below my different results and reports.
