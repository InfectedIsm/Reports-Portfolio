# About Infect3d
Previously working as test & measurement engineer in telecommunications.
Now a smart contract security researcher, my goal is to master both broad coverage and deep exploration of the codebase.
With a specific focus on Solidity, I aim to cover all types of protocols.
However, you will see from my CV that I have an affinity for CDP, DEXes, Vaults and AMMs protocols as they highly rely on maths.

I participate in contests on [Code4rena](https://code4rena.com/), [Sherlock](https://www.sherlock.xyz/) or [CodeHawks](https://www.codehawks.com/)

You'll find below my different results and reports.
